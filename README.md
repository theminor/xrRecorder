# xrRecorder
My own simple custom web app I use to control my recording setup for my xr18. I have my xr18 connected to a raspberry Pi that runs a minimal node server and sox. This is just a frontend to turn recording on and off and issue the appropriate sox commands.
It also offers some file management and other trivial, but useful tasks.

## To Do:
- [ ] Add ability to playback files such as house music over USB
